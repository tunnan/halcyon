# Halcyon

Halcyon is a very small static page generator, using it's own s-expression interpreter.
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Why would anyone create webpages usign s-expression?". Good question.

This is just a fun project of mine, so I would not recommend anyone to actually use it in any project.
